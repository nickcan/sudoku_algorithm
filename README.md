# Sudoku Algorithm

This is a refactored version of my sudoku algorithm that I completed during week 1, Phase 1 of Dev Bootcamp.  The algorithm uses *Recursive Backtracking* to solve very difficult boards.

I have left comments to clarify what each method does within the Sudoku class.

**Input** - String (81 character Sudoku board)

**Output** - Is a formatted board in the terminal. It clears the screen so the act of solving the board can be viewed. It also displays if the board was "Solved!" or not and the time taken to complete it.
